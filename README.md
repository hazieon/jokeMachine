# Dad jokes generator app

Haha! A react app using requests to an API to generate random 'dad jokes'. 
A solo project from early in my code learning journey, but finished off later on. 
I used React and JavaScript to fetch random jokes from an API.

# Get some jokes

dod-jokes.netlify.app/

# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run the app locally
clone down the repository

## 'npm i'
install the dependencies in the project folder

## `npm start`
Run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.
